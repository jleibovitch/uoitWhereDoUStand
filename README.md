# WhereDoUStand

This was a project built for Local Hack Day 2017 hackathon. The concept was to use machine learning to predict how you may do in a future year, based on the grades you got in your other courses. It was planned to be involved so that the community of UOIT can contribute just by signing in. Although there were many technical difficuilties this is the project we came up with.

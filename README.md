# WhereDoUStand

This was a project built for Local Hack Day 2017 hackathon. The concept was to use machine learning to predict how you may do in a future year, based on the grades you got in your other courses. It was planned to be involved so that the community of UOIT can contribute just by signing in. 

## Info

At the current moment, all that is possible is for students to log in. The program will print in console the student's grades taht were achieved. 

## Security

At the moment, absolutely no information is stored. We will never store any passwords, just the info we need for this project (i.e. grades and student id associated with them)

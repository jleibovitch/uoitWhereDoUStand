# WhereDoUStand

This was a project built for Local Hack Day 2017 hackathon. The concept was to use machine learning to predict how you may do in a future year, based on the grades you got in your other courses. It was planned to be involved so that the community of UOIT can contribute just by signing in. Although there were many technical difficuilties this is the project we came up with.

## Info

This project doesn't work the way it was intented. There _is_ a web interface, but for some reason it doesn't generate a .csv file, and we didn't have enough time to fix the issue, so there isn't any linking to the data. We also couldn't get past the school's firewall to access the grades, even though no data other than the grades were saved. We ended up scrapping that, and just creating a simple interface where you can manually add your gpa. For this project we also assumed that 12 courses were taken, just so we could keep the data as accurate as possible.
